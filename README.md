# 🌿 My Journey - Personal Website
## NOTE: used chatGPT for creating this README.md

Welcome to **My Journey**, a minimalist and emotional visual diary built using **HTML5** and **Bootstrap 5**. This website is a personal project that reflects my thoughts, growth, and love for nature through carefully selected imagery and a clean layout.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 🌟 Features

- **Clean and simple layout** designed with Bootstrap Flexbox utilities.
- **Nature-themed imagery** expressing peace, emotion, and introspection.
- **Inline CSS styling** for layout customization.
- **CDN-loaded Bootstrap** for fast loading and responsiveness.

## ✅ What Works Well

- ✅ Neat use of Bootstrap layout classes like `d-flex`, `justify-content-center`.
- ✅ Emotionally resonant visuals enhance the story.
- ✅ Clear personal identity in the design.

## ⚠️ What Needs Improvement

1. **File Naming & Organization**
   - Avoid **spaces** in image file names.
     - `green trees.jpg` → `green_trees.jpg`
     - `autumunleaves.jpg` → fix spelling or rename clearly.
   - Keep file names lowercase and use underscores or hyphens.

2. **CSS Optimization**
   - Use more descriptive class names (e.g., `.left` → `.centered-image`).
   - Review unnecessary styles like `flex: auto`.

3. **Accessibility & SEO**
   - Add `alt` attributes to all images.
   - Include semantic HTML tags: `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.
   - Add meta tags like:
     ```html
     <meta name="description" content="Arin's personal journey shared through visuals and emotion.">
     ```

4. **Responsiveness**
   - Ensure the layout looks good on all screen sizes.
   - Consider wrapping sections in Bootstrap’s grid system (`container`, `row`, `col`).
